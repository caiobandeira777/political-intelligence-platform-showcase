> > > ## 🎯 The problem
> > >
> > > Parliamentary offices and campaigns drown in data scattered across dozens of sources — electoral records, congress, public spending portals, census (IBGE), social media — and lack the time or tools to turn it into decisions. Mandato365 bridges that gap: **from raw data to strategy, automatically.**
